# DevOps Core Fundamental Project 
The aim of this project is to create a fully functioning CRUD application, which allows me to develop and showcase the core modules that I covered during the first 4 weeks of my training.

This project will thus allow my trainers to assess my capabilities with the techonologies and methodologies I have been taught, as well as assessing my development against the SFIA.


## Game reviewing App
This application is game reviewing web application where Users can Create, Update, Delete and Read their reviews. User's are able to recomend similar games in their reviews, creating a relationship between games that already exist in the Database.
