# DevOps Core Fundamental Project 
The aim of this project is to create a fully functioning CRUD application, which allows me to develop and showcase the core modules that I covered during the first 4 weeks of my training.

This project will thus allow my trainers to assess my capabilities with the techonologies and methodologies I have been taught, as well as assessing my development against the SFIA.

## Requirements
The following requirements are also expected to be achieved alongside the aims of this project:
* The use of a Trello Board(s) to prove an Agile methodology has been considered
* The use of a relational database, with atleast one relationship
* The use of fully designed test suites, with automated tests to ensure a high rate of code coverage in both the front and back-end. 
* The use of flask  to help create a functioniong website
* The use of GitHub and Virtual machines hosted on the Google Cloud Platform, allowing for version control via a CI server.

## Game reviewing App
To help me achieve the aims and requirements of this project, I will create a game reviewing web application.

When the user attempts to create a review, he/she will be asked to input the following:
  * Title of the review
  * Body of the review
  * Other game recomendations
  * Name of the author
  * Rating out of 5

Furthermore, user's will also be able to read other reviews, and as well as edit and delete their own reviews.
